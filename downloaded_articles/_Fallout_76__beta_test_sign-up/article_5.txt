Bethesda.net DOWN: Fallout 76 beta sign-ups unavailable due to server crash
BETHESDA's website is down, as thousands of fans attempt to sign up for the Fallout 76 beta.
Bethesda.net appears to be down for fans hoping to sign up for the Fallout 76 beta.
The Fallout 76 beta test was announced alongside the game's release date during Bethesda's E3 2018 conference.
" We want YOU to be involved in our Break-it Early Test Application for # Fallout76. # BE3," reads a Bethesda tweet.
Fans can sign up for the beta by visiting the Bethesda website, although this seems to have crashed due to demand.
With Fallout 76 coming to PS4, Xbox One and PC in November, the pre-release beta is expected to take place around a month before launch.
Bethesda also revealed plans to release a special edition of the game.
The Fallout 76 Power Armor Edition comes with a Wearable T-51b helmet, a Glow-in-the-Dark vintage terrain map, 24 Fallout Figurines and Tricentennial Edition Bonus In-Game Items.
